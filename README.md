# RepoScrapaThingaMaBobber
Scrapes Reposity Packages and outputs to a text file. Will be used to compare local Repo/packages to what's available remotely.

Todo: Add Test, settings, compare features, save file to directory and save file path for previous runs of that particular Repo,
      add Repo to the list on menu for quick connects, show directory paths (that'll come in a gui and what not later).
      

Want to help? Feel free to fork, I'm learning and this is just a small project I decided to start working on.
Also if you see where I can improve the code please let me know.
